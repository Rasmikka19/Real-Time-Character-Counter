📝 Real-Time Character Counter

This is a simple Real-Time Character Counter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to type text inside a textarea while showing a live count of how many characters have been typed and how many are remaining.

🔧 Features

Displays a maximum character limit (e.g., 200 characters max).

Updates the character count in real time as the user types.

Shows both typed and remaining characters (e.g., 150/200 characters).

Prevents users from typing more than the allowed number of characters.

Displays a warning message when the character limit is reached.

💡 How It Works

The project contains a single index.html file that includes all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

JavaScript listens to the input event on the textarea to dynamically update the character counter.

The character limit logic ensures that typing stops once the limit is reached.

🚀 Technologies Used

HTML – for the structure

CSS – for styling the layout

JavaScript – for real-time interaction
